### Basic information
- paper name: [EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.11946)
- author: Mingxing Tan
- from: Google
- EfficientNet-B7 achieved the highest accuracy of the year at 84.3% on ImageNet top-1. 
- Compared to the previous highest accuracy model, GPipe, EfficientNet-B7 has only 1/8.4 the number of parameters and a 6.1 times faster inference speed.
- It also explores the impact of **input resolution**, **network depth**, and **network width**.

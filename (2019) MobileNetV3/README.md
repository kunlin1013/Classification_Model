### Identified problems
Previous models were enlarged at all costs for the sake of improving scores, making them impractical for real-time implementation on mobile devices. To address this issue, Google introduced MobileNet.

### Depthwise separable convolution => Depthwise conv + Pointwise conv => reduce parameters (MobileNetV1)
- Normal convolution => the convolutional layer has a total of 4 filters, each containing 3 kernels, with each kernel size being 3Ã—3. Therefore, the number of parameters in the convolutional layer can be calculated using the following formula:
```
Parameters: 4 x 3 x 3 x 3 = 108
```
